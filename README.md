The XPath Validation Script is a useful tool designed to simplify the process of finding the exact XPath expressions for data points when working on data scraping or website test automation using Selenium. This script saves you time and effort by loading your target web page and allowing you to test XPath expressions directly.

- PHP installed on your system.
- Access to a web server or a local development environment.

Follow the steps below to use the XPath verification script:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine or web server.
2. Ensure that the `xPathVerify.php` script is placed in a directory accessible by your web server or PHP interpreter.
3. Go to that directory and run `php xPathVerify.php`
4. Give required input.
5. Give `text` as attribute when you need to see nodevalue of selected element, any other input ie. `href`, `src` will be processed as attributes of element .
